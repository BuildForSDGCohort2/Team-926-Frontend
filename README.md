# Team-926-Patient-Solution
This App is a patient solution kit in which the patient can collect any health information needed.
Afrihealthstore is an acronym for African Health Store.

I am building a digital health platform to connect doctors and their patients. This App supports the goal of continuous care for the health and the need to store health data (information) by providing healthcare providers with a Virtual Practice that enables them to be securely accessible to their patients, through web and mobile services enabling online consultations and remote patient monitoring. Virtual Practice also supports essential practice management functions and online presence management for better patient engagement. The app when ready will also enable government health officials to monitor and to follow the flow of health care services like medicine distribution which help reduce or rather eliminate the diversion of medicines meant to patients freely to individual businesses hence crippling governmentsâ€™ efforts to support their citizens who are vulnerable. This app will bring quality in health service delivery.
